frontend structure we will follow

assets - for images, fonts, etc

components - reusable ui components such as buttons, modals, navbar, etc

features - contains game logic/components. each game will have its own folder in here

hooks - for our custom hooks that share logic such as auth, game states, websocket?

layout - might not need but this is for structure of app such as dashboard layout for logged in users vs public layout for non logged in users

pages - general

utils - for helper functions that are reused

store - state management stuff like redux (might not need)

services - API stuff to connect w backend, websocket stuff as well?
