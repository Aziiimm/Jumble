# Jumble ðŸŽ®

## Project Scope

Jumble is a party game web app. The goal is to let people play casual games in real time with friends/AI (similar to jackbox/gamepigeon/jklm). The first game will be called **Word Hunter** (based on Word Hunt from gamepigeon). It will support up to 8 players per room for multiplayer, and track wins with a leaderboard system.

Multiplayer will work via room codes (user creates a room, gets a code, others join using it). Leaderboard tracks all-time wins. AI opponent will be require training a ML model (down the line).

Goal is to make a solid base for more games to be added later.
